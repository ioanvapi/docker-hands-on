# Docker bridge network

The default network driver. If you donâ€™t specify a driver, this is the type of network you are creating. Bridge networks are usually used when your applications run in standalone containers that need to communicate.

User-defined bridge networks are best when you need multiple containers to communicate on the same Docker host.


```docker
# list networks
docker networl ls
```

```docker
docker network inspect bridge
```

```bash
{
    "Name": "bridge",        
    "Scope": "local",
    "Driver": "bridge",
    "IPAM": {
        "Driver": "default",

                "Gateway": "172.17.0.1"
            }
        ]
    },
    ....
    "Options": {
